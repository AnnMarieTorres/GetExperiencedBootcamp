# GetExperiencedBootcamp
Bootcamp designed to create real world team experience

Hey There,

I want to welcome you to the Get Experienced Coding Bootcamp.  My whole goal in doing this is to give people the chance to learn software engineering in a context that mimics the real world.  Whatever level you are at, we are going to be learning by doing.

You all will be split into teams; with each team member having different responsibilities. We will use Python/Django, HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, CentOS (Linux), Apache, Git/Github, SCRUM / Agile, QA and Automated Testing.  Whew!! That was a lot of buzzwords; but when you see how they all fit together, you will see that they really aren’t that scary!

We will split out each learning session based on the different responsibilities:

1.  Server Administration and Setup
2.  Front End Developer 1 (HTML/CSS)
3.  Front End Developer 2 (Javascript/jQuery/Angular/..)
4.  Backend Developer (Python/Django)
5.  Database Administrator
6.  SCRUM Master / System Architect / Project Manager (will touch a little of all the above)

I will create videos or go live for each learning session, so you can all review them at anytime.  You are welcome to view all learning sessions, but you will be responsible for homework, quizzes and tests for your specific job assignment.  You are welcome to complete any other assignment/assessment on top of that.  If the position assigned to you is too hard or too easy, talk it out in your group and figure out who can handle what responsibilities and get back to me.  You are welcome to swap within your group.  If life is getting too hard and it’s becoming hard to find time, please don’t quit!  Treat this like a high-paying, remote position.  Your teammates are going to be relying on your expertise to get the site up and for you to succeed!

The learning sessions will comprise of me going over some topics, showing some cool things, but will be mainly for answering any questions or doing coding examples of things you might have gotten stuck on.  The bulk of the learning will be you trying to code a project, or reading/watching videos/reviewing on your own time.  You are responsible for your own learning.  Ask questions of your teammates, other teams, me, StackOverflow, or anywhere else if you have an issue or just don’t get it.  I will give you links to material that is already out on the web that pertains to each lesson.  

Homework will be outlines/notes of all videos and readings.  I will provide a document on how to format your notes.  Each lesson will have quizzes to test your knowledge.  Tests will occur after each sprint.  We will do performance reviews after each project.  You will also provide feedback about your experience and review teammates.  This means be nice, be responsible and work hard. But I also want you to own your work and be confident in your code (because you thought it out, coded it cleanly and throughly tested your work).  I encourage teams to help out other teams and for everyone to chat it up as much as possible.

You all will own your projects and will be encouraged to actually go live with your sites (get a domain name, promote it, etc…) and maintain them after this bootcamp.  You are really building your resume right now.  All of these things are requirements for any 6 figure salaried position.  So take this serious, take your time and become great!  I can’t fire you!

Please reach out to your other teammates and begin organizing.  We are going to start by building an informational website/blog from scratch; about some new, interesting technology that doesn’t have a good web presence yet.  This can be about Artificial Intelligence, Alexa, Machine Learning, React.js, anything!!!  But our goal is to create the best site we can.  This will include: aggregating all the best sites that are related to the technology, blog articles/reviews, rss feed, as well as new features that you will plan and implement.  

The site will be built with the Django framework for Python.  The database will be MySQL.  We will use CSS3 and HTML5.  For the Javascript, we will use jQuery.  The server will be running CentOS (a flavor of Linux).  There will be unit tests and we will do some browser tests with Selenium.  This will be an Agile environment and we will be using SCRUM.  The project manager of each team will be responsible for filling out the daily form on the website (link to be provide soon) summarizing the team’s daily progress.  We will go in 2 week sprints.  We will communicate with Basecamp, Slack, Facebook, email, Google Hangouts and Skype.

As a team, you need to organize and decide the following things:
1. Team name
2. Team mascot
3. Time of day for your daily standup (quick 5 -10 minute check in; can be in the form of an email or on Slack)
4. Day of the week for your weekly meeting (we will all do a google hangout once a week to catch up and figure out next steps)
5.  What technology you want to create the site about
6.  You need to sign up for an AWS free account (this requires a credit card; so the server admin/SCRUM Master will be responsible for figuring this out)
7.  You will need to create a SauceLab account at the lowest tier (free for 30 days and $19/month after that)
8.  If you don’t have an IDE/editor that can handle Python, HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript, I suggest we all use Sublime 3.  Here is a tutorial on how to set it up:

There are informational links provided in this email that you will need.

The coding bootcamp will kick of this Monday, at 6pm Pacific.  I will go live on Facebook and give a presentation, as well as answer any questions.  I will email you all further information at that time (class schedule, office hours, slack channel, Basecamp logins, etc….).
